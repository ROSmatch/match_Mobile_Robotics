## 1. Setup Simulation <a name = "setup_sim"></a>

1. Launch a world 
``` 
roslaunch match_gazebo big_square.launch 
``` 
2. Spawn MuRs with different namespaces
``` 
roslaunch mur_examples multi_mur620_handling.launch
``` 
Make sure move_group is successfully loaded. Maybe you have to re-spawn the robots with gazebo running (delete them in gazebo and ctrl+c the launch file terminal). If move_group is successfull, the manipulators should all move to their home position. If everything has been started correctly, the robots should now look like in the picture.

3. Move the robots to their handling position
``` 
roslaunch mur_examples multi_mur620_handling.launch
``` 
The robots are moved using move_group. This may take a while.

4. Switch the robot to twist control
```
rosrun mur_examples switch_URs_to_twist_control.py
```
So far the official UR ROS package does not provide a twist controller in gazebo (only in hardware).
Instead we use a custom twist controller based on the inverse differential kinematics and the joint_group_vel controller.
